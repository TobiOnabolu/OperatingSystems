To rename makefile.mk to makefile, run:

$mv makefile.gmk makefile

Place makefile is in the same folder where your all .c files are and to compile via terminal, run the command:

$ make

If you want instead run Question 1 (make sure that your input.txt is in the same folder) then use command:

$ make runq1 

For Question 2,  (make sure that your sample_in.txt is in the same folder) run

$ make runq2

To clean out the directory, you can use:

$make clean
